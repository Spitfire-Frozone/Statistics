    "This is a small practical introduction into likelihood fitting which is a common tool in many analyses. We will get you thinking about what happens in a fit over several hundred bins by looking what happens for 1 bin which is relatively trivial. More details an be found in p415-419 in PhD Research Book III.\n",

    "You are looking for some new thing. Lets say it's a new particle. Luckily for you this new particle decays into particles you already know exist (lets say a pair of 𝑏-quarks). An observation of this particle therefore will manifest itself as additional counts in the bins of the total cross section of 𝑋→𝑏𝑏. How can you quantify the presence of an additional particle in events in 𝑋→𝑏𝑏 given that there are going to be fluctuations as standard in these bins when you are looking in this channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a robust model of your background to form the null hypothesis such that you can test how likely possible upward fluctations are in your signal region. To ensure that the background model is accurate, what you can do is compare it to background data in a region of phase space that is not relevant to the signal (i.e one where your physics model should still be able give a perscription of the goings on and predict how many events will occur but will have little to no contribution from the signal you are looking for to that event count). This is where the likelihood comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood is a way of describing your nominal physics model and accounting for statistical fluctuations in counts. Your nominal background expectation will come from monte carlo (MC) generated events created under a nominal physics model.\n",

    "The likelihood also has some flexibility in terms of Nuisance Parameters (NP). A NP is a essentially a given parameter in your physics model that is not fully underrstood or subject to change. Variations in that NP will vary processes in your model and therefore increase/decrease the number of counts you see in the bins where that NP is relevant. Some NP's will have a larger effect on the number of counts in a bin than others.\n",

    "Here in the second plot, the equation used to calculate the impact on mu was linear. Often when the prediction is close to zero and the systematics are large $\\mu$ can end up being negative. In reality as $\\mu$ is a real quality (as in it is usually a estimated number of counts in a bin) this is unphysical and when more systematics get added into the mix which multiplicatively augment $\\mu$, any scale factors that affect $\\mu$ negative will have adverse affects which will cause problems in the fit later on. \n",

The solution to the systematic making $\\mu$ not be less than zero in a continuous way is to connect the two extrapolation exponentials with a piecewise linear function. This means the systematic is linear  in the region we need it to be linear while being fixed at the edges with defined values as to not have discontinuities with the exponential functions on it's boundaries.
