    "This is a small practical introduction into likelihood fitting which is a common tool in many analyses. We will get you thinking about what happens in a fit over several hundred bins by looking what happens for 1 bin which is relatively trivial.

    "You are looking for some new thing. Lets say it's a new particle. Luckily for you this new particle decays into particles you already know exist (lets say a pair of 𝑏-quarks). An observation of this particle therefore will manifest itself as additional counts in the bins of the total cross section of 𝑋→𝑏𝑏. How can you quantify the presence of an additional particle in events in 𝑋→𝑏𝑏 given that there are going to be fluctuations as standard in these bins when you are looking in this channel?\n",

    "You need a robust model of your background to form the null hypothesis such that you can test how likely possible upward fluctations are in your signal region. To ensure that the background model is accurate, what you can do is compare it to background data in a region of phase space that is not relevant to the signal (i.e one where your physics model should still be able give a perscription of the goings on and predict how many events will occur but will have little to no contribution from the signal you are looking for to that event count). This is where the likelihood comes in.\n",

Some NP's will have a larger effect on the number of counts in a bin than others.\n",
